# 📊 Amazon Sales Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

Hi! Welcome to my project. I built this end-to-end dashboard to analyze Amazon's sales performance. I handled everything from writing complex SQL queries to designing a 4-page interactive dashboard in Power BI.

##  Project Highlights
* **Profitability:** Identified a strong **40% Overall Profit Margin**.
* **Product Strategy:** Categorized "Superstars" (High Profit) vs "Underperformers" (Low Profit).
* **Inventory Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of stock levels to prevent out-of-stock situations.
* **Customer Retention:** Analyzed New vs. Returning customer trends.
