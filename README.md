# Amazon Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

Hi, I am Tanishka.

In this project, I used a SQL database of Amazon sales containing 9 tables. Using this structured dataset, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze business performance.

This project presents a 3-year analysis (2023–2025) of Amazon sales.  
The dataset used in this project was generated using AI for learning and practice purposes.

## Source Database (SQL)

The source database and SQL scripts used for data preparation and analysis are available here:

This dashboard helps understand how the business is performing and where improvements can be made.

## Dashboard Pages

### 1. Sales Overview

This page provides a quick summary of overall business performance.

It includes:

- Total Orders, Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity displayed in numeric form  
- Monthly order trend analysis (March is the highest order-receiving month)  
- Two donut charts showing:
  - Category contribution to total orders  
  - Customer payment mode preferences  
- Top-performing states receiving the highest number of orders  
- Top sellers whose products are most preferred by customers  

This page helps understand priority states, payment trends, category performance, and seller contribution. It gives a complete overview of the business in one place.
